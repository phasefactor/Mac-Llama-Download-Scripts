# MacLlamaDownloadScripts
MacOS replacements for the download.sh scripts included in Meta's Llama related repositories.

By default MacOS does not have `wget` and uses a version of `md5` that does not handle checklist files.  These versions of the scripts will work as expected using `curl` and the MacOS version of `md5`.
